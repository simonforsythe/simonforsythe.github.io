<p>My childhood best friend recently beat cancer for the second time. Things were looking grim for a while. One day, he came to me saying that he had started collecting Pokemon cards again - something we had done together 20 years ago. It gave him a distraction, and something we could talk about aside from cancer and the good old days.</p>

<p>After he showed me some of his collection, I started doing some research and found that the TCG market had grown significantly since we were kids, and is projected to grow much further in the coming years. When I first heard this, I considered holding sealed product as a speculative bet. However, speculation isn't dependable, and I had just gotten laid off from my job at Iron Fox. So, what's a fella to do?</p>

<p>Sell sealed products, obviously. But this came with issues. Big issues. In order to get a distributor for Pokemon products, you need a brick & mortar location. That's a big step for someone who ideally wants to invest less than 10k of starting capital. I needed a plan that would make ecommerce a viable option. That's where Japanese cards come in.</p>

<p>Go back a few years, and Japanese TCG cards were extremely niche in NA. Now there's tons of interest. This can be attributed to higher quality in Japanese cards, as well as exclusive cards. For example, the extremely popular Pokemon 151 set has masterball foil variations of many cards which can't be found in English.</p>

<p>Japanese sealed product can be sourced without the need for a brick & mortar store. This evened out the playing field. Now my store can be run online-only, allowing me to provide very fair margins to NA customers.</p>



<h2 class="section-heading">Pros of Tidalbox as online-only</h2>

<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">Scale up and down more easily.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">More automation. The only thing I really do at this point is order from suppliers, pack shipments, and answer chats.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Sleep in. No B&M to look after. No rent!</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Leaves more room for running other businesses or working a day job. No need to hire employees (yet).</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Allows for specialization. It would be hard to run a B&M store that's as specialized as Tidalbox.</li>
  </ul>

  
<h2 class="section-heading">Cons of Tidalbox as online-only</h2>

<ul class="list-group">
    <li class="list-group-item">Takes up office and storage space in the home. If working a day job, having two spaces taken up for work really has an impact. However, I have a unit below my house now to run the business from.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Late hours talking with Japanese suppliers.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">Locked into niche Japanese products for the midterm.</li>
    <li class="list-group-item">High shipping costs, which are offset by charging shipping on orders under $200 CAD.</li>
  </ul>

<p>Founding Tidalbox TCG has allowed me to have a relatively low-effort revenue stream that ties into a lively and positive TCG community!</p>
