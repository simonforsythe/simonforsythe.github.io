<p>League of Legends has been my favorite game since 2011. But boy does it have some design stink. Among the top offenders is Teemo, commonly referred to as Satan himself. IYKYK.</p>

<p>Teemo has been a poorly designed champion forever, and it's likely the design team can't decide what to do about him. Below is my opinion on how to properly redesign him:</p>
<p></p>

<p>Before offering solutions, let me outline why he's problematic: </p>

<ul class="list-group">
  <li class="list-group-item">He doesn't fit well into any role, so gets pigeonholed into being a ranged top-laner. Ranged top laners tend to cause problems in general.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">His kit has no skillshots. His only outplay potential is timing his Q blind, and playing bush games. His gameplay is too linear</li>
  <li class="list-group-item">Other than his ult, which is negative fun to play against, he doesn't have a good teamfight angle unless he's solo hitting the adc. </li>
</ul>

<p>So how do we fix this mess?</p>

<ul class="list-group"></ul>
  <li class="list-group-item"><b>Passive:</b> Teemo's auto attacks and abilities apply a stack of poison, up to 3 stacks. Stacks fall off after 1 second. After reaching 3 stacks, stacks begin to fall off after 3 seconds. Adding a stack resets the timer. Poisoned enemies receive magic DPS.</li>
  <li class="list-group-item"><b>Q:</b></b> (Skillshot, 700 range) fire a dart in the target direction which pierces through enemies. Deals magic damage, increased by 25% if the target is over 400 units away. If the enemy has 3 poison stacks, they are blinded for ~(2.2/2.3/2.4/2.5/2.6) seconds </li>
  <li class="list-group-item"><b>W: </b>(Passive, active) passive: gain (5%/10%/15%/20%/25%) movespeed while standing in any ally poison effect including his own (i.e this would work for ally Cassiopeia W, as well as his own E). Active:  gain a significant speed boost for 0.5 seconds and gain a small shield for every poisoned enemy within 800 units. </li>
  <li class="list-group-item"><b>E: </b>(skillshot, 750 range) Quickly toss a noxious concoction at the ground. Enemies who touch the poison get slowed for 0.5 seconds and gain 3 poison stacks. The effect's radius is (200/250/300/350/400) units </li>
  <li class="list-group-item"><b>R:</b> (skillshot, 900 range) Shoot a large neurotoxic dart that pierces enemies. Enemies hit receive (200/300/400) magic damage and are slowed for (0.8/1/1.2) seconds. Enemies with 3 stacks of poison are stunned instead, have their stacks removed, receive 25% increased damage from this ability, and you gain 10% movement speed towards them for 3 seconds.</li>

</ul>

<p>Now, teemo has abilities that he can miss, which can be played around. His Q will not always proc a blind instantly. His E slow, W shield and R stun will give him tools to engage teamfights and survive them. Champions who have CC on their auto attacks can do a little bit better in Teemo matchups by not getting instantly blinded, under the right circumstances.</p>
<p>This may not be a perfect rework, but it's a good starting point. Teemo needs to be stopped!</p>
