<p>I was wrong in my last post - Udio does allow users to download stems. But they are terrible. They bleed into each other a lot, have inconsistencies, and are generally garbage. However, I found StemRoller, which does a great job.</p>
<p>Below is a song I salvaged by rolling stems from an Udio track and doing some magic.</p>

<p>For those curious, here is the original audio from Udio.</p>

<p>All I had to do was some editing/automating on the vocals and add vocal chops. It became a listenable song very fast, which is terrifying. It would have taken me a week to produce/mix/master. Stay tuned for more, I guess.</p>
