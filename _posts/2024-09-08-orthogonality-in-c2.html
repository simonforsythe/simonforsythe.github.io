<p>Welcome to my 1st profound information dump post. Below is a curated list of cool things!</p>

<p><b>Photopea</b><br>
It surprises me how so many people are unaware of <a href="https://www.photopea.com">Photopea!</a> This is a shockingly good Photoshop clone that can be used for quick day-to-day edits and mockups.</p>

<p><b>The Theoretical Minimum</b><br>
The theoretical minimum is a book series and lecture series by Leonard Susskind which aims to provide non-academics access to physics. It's split into classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and GR. Particularly, I'm interested in the quantum mechanics lectures. The only pre-reqs are calculus and linear algebra. Maybe do a brush up on complex vector spaces first. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iJfw6lDlTuA&list=PL09HhnlAMGuprvZVNjMRrF3MFTH2GoP4J">Here</a> is the QM series, for free.</p>

<p><b>Spinors for Beginners (Eigenchris)</b><br>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5soqexrwqY">Here</a> is a video series on spinors by Eigenchris. In the first video, at 4:43, there is a nice intuition about the orthogonality of spin up and spin down state vectors, which was something I had a hard time with, coming from working with vectors in real space.</p>


<p><b>Udio (generative music AI)</b><br>
If you haven't been under a rock, you've probably played with <a href="https://www.udio.com/home">Udio</a> or a similar tool. However, it deserves a mention now because it supports inpainting. This makes it actually somewhat usable. Now we just need stems.</p>
