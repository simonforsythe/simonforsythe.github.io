<p>I recently decided to deep dive into web dev. Over the past 10+ years I've picked up odds and ends, but haven't worked with any of the major frameworks/libraries.</p>
<p>My first project is a <a href="https://simonforsythe.github.io/perfectpomodoro/">pomodoro timer</a>.</a></p>
<p>While doing this project I learned to let go of classic DOM manipulation and rely on React hooks. I only had to use useState and useEffect hooks in this project.</p>
<p>Close to the end of building this, I realized it would be a lot better to nest components, which I'll try out in the next project. For example, both the on-screen button panels are different components, but the container definitely doesn't have to be.</p>
