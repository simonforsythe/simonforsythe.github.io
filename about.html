<p><i>This is my personal blog. Opinions and ideas are my own.</i></p>

<p>I'm a polymath via curiosity.</p>

<p>Whether it's making games, building guitars, ripping out plumbing, or philosophizing about interpretations of quantum mechanics, I'm addicted to finding out how things work.</p>

<p>In terms of professional skills, I'm experienced in game production, Unity development, and game design. I've worked on military tools, slot games, mobile games, PC games, web games, and more. I'm a beginner web developer.</p>
